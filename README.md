# Codes from Coursera

Coursera上学习过的课程的代码

## 课程目录
1. [Data Science 专项课程](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
from Johns Hopkins University
> This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.
2. [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
from Stanford
> This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
> (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
> (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
> (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
> The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. 
3. [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)
from University of Washington
> This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.
4. [Software Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-security)
from University of Maryland
> This course we will explore the foundations of software security. We will consider important software vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit them -- such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and session hijacking -- and we will consider defenses that prevent or mitigate these attacks, including advanced testing and program analysis techniques. Importantly, we take a "build security in" mentality, considering techniques at each phase of the development cycle that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems. Successful learners in this course typically have completed sophomore/junior-level undergraduate work in a technical field, have some familiarity with programming, ideally in C/C++ and one other "managed" program language (like ML or Java), and have prior exposure to algorithms. Students not familiar with these languages but with others can improve their skills through online web tutorials.
